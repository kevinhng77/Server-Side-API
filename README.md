# My-Portfolio

## Description 

This project is a perfect example of building something that is usable in the real world. As you will notice in this project, it incorporates a lot of useful things that are actually applicable that we learned in class. One can decide to use HTML, Javascript, and CSS, as well as other frameworks to make your life easier/ harder. In this scenario, there was a combination of all three as well as JQuery and Bootstrap. These two frameworks are built on top of the already well- known languages to make the coders job more simpler. In a lot of cases, professional software engineers may need to iterate and change up the variables in the HTML and Javascript. A lot of typing would be needed if you were to go to the document and select the text that you want. However, with Jquery, this is much easier to use. All you have to do is link the JQuery to the HTML file and all the methods that were created by other people are there. This is also true for Bootstrap. Instead of having to go through CSS and individually creating cards and sections, Bootstrap allows the user to format their page much easier. On top of that, we also introduced API keys, which is really useful to gather data from the web.

## Installation

First, by cloning the repository down to your computer, you can copy down the existing index.html file. Next, open it up with GitBash and type in "code ." , which should open up VSCode. From there, there were a lot of errors and things that needed to be fixed, which will be went over in the next section.


## Usage 

From opening the front page, you are immediately greeted with big Weather Dashboard icons as well as a search bar for your specific city. In this scenario, we are using the API of OpenWeather and gathering data. From the link, we can search through using a specific city name, which is given to us through the user's input. This is then transferred into a function which calls the data and makes it into a very user friendly type of play.

The next thing you'll notice is that once you searched up the specific city that you want, you will be greeted with cards that show the city's weather information. The temperature, moisture, and everythign are displayd in friendly icons. On top of the current day being the most bold and up to date, there are also 5 more days which showcase the use of this application.

[Example 2](./assets/example-2.png)

You'll notice that when you go to the Javascript file of this project, the majority of the code is there. THe HTML and CSS were mainly empty due to the fact that there were elements being dynamically created in the Javascript, which allowed those two files to mostly be no use. On top of using the useful frameworks spoken at the top of this project, Javascript was the main driving force of this project.

Special shoutout to TA Kyle Vance for assisting me with this project. He helped me learn the structure in which files should be presented in Github, as well as figure out some things about how Github pages works.
